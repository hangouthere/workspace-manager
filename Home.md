# WorkSpace Manager

Do you often want a complex set of applications/files open to start working? Do you always forget to launch that one application when sitting down to work? Do you have different methods of working depending on the task at hand?

I know I do, so I set out to build a simple tool to make it super easy to get your WorkSpace defined and manageable.

With **WorkSpace Manager**, you can get your environment up and running within mere seconds!

# Features

## Multiple Workspace configurations for any scenario

Quickly switch between WorkSpaces simply by using a different configuration. You can even tidy up your WorkSpace by re-running the same config to put everything where it belongs - at your ready!

## Run Apps, URLs, or open a file with the default program

Target an EXE, Windows Shortcut, launch a URL, or even just a regular file and let Windows decide how to open it.

## Quickly "Hunt" Windows with **Window Hunter**

Figuring out exact pixel dimensions can be painful, so let us do the dirty work for you. **Window Hunter** will find all open Windows and tons of meta-data to make adding an entry into the WorkSpace painless.

## Position Windows

Put Windows *exactly* where you want them, every time. *WorkSpace Manager* supports absolute positioning (i.e., `500, 200`) or as a percentage of the monitor (i.e., `25%, 15%`). It even supports *negative* offsets to start from the opposite edge (i.e., `-100, -100` will offset 100 pixels from the bottom right of a Monitor). You can even control various aspects such as whether the Window should be Maximized, or Minimized.

## Multi-Monitor Support

Want a specific window on your left Monitor, and another on your right Monitor? We have you covered! 

With Monitor translations built-in, you don't need to worry about crazy offsets like `(-2250, 450)` to target a specific Monitor - go with what feels right and use coordinates relative to the targeted Monitor.

## Send Mouse/Keyboard instructions to an Application

Sometimes an Application isn't quite ready for immediate use the way you want, or maybe you want a new document started every time.

**WorkSpace Manager** is capable of sending advanced keystrokes and mouse gestures to any Window targeted in the config.

## Change Window Styles

Want a Window to Always be on Top, remove the Max/Min buttons, or maybe you'd like some fancy transparency? Take full control of the Window and have your WorkSpace tailored to your specific needs!
