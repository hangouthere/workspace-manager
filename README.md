# WorkSpace Manager

Do you often want a complex set of applications/files open to start working? Do you always forget to launch that one application when sitting down to work? Do you have different methods of working depending on the task at hand?

I know I do, so I set out to build a simple tool to make it super easy to get your WorkSpace defined and manageable.

With **WorkSpace Manager**, you can get your environment up and running within mere seconds!
